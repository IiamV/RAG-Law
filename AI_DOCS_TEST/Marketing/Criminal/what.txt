Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and lower long-term costs. Unlike traditional gas-powered cars, EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions and often have fewer moving parts, resulting in less maintenance. Governments around the world are offering incentives such as tax credits, rebates, and free charging to encourage consumers to switch to electric. However, concerns remain about battery range, charging infrastructure, and the environmental impact of battery production.
